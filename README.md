While this applies to more than just vectors, I will be focusing on them in my examples and proof of concept, as their API is relatively simple and they are the most ubiquitous and error-prone collection in my experience.

# The problem


I frequently find myself working with vectors that have certain invariant qualities that *I* know, but I cannot tell the compiler without `unsafe`. 

For example,

```rust
fn do_something(vec: Vec<_>) {
    vec.push(value);
    vec.first().expect("value should exist at first index")
}
```

This code will never panic as-is. Nevertheless, we have to either do unnecessary error handling for a None path that will never be returned, or we must use panicking functions like `unwrap` or `expect`.

Using panicking functions can lead to a DOS condition if the invariant relationship is broken at some point, making the panicking path accessible.

```rust
fn push_and_ref(vec: &mut Vec<String>, value: String) -> &mut String {
    // this is a minimal case, but invariant relationships like this often exist in larger contexts that are more difficult to reason about

    // if removed / reordered, the line below may panic, depending on the state of `vec`
    vec.push(value); 
    vec.last_mut().expect("value should exist at last index")
}
```

We can try to add error handling, but in some cases, this can be more trouble than it's worth.

How do you handle a value that should never exist?

How do you test a code path that never executes?

```rust
// we have to return an Option, even though this function will never return `None`
fn push_and_ref(vec: &mut Vec<String>, value: String) -> Option<&mut String> {
    vec.push(value);
    
    // how do we convince the compiler that `last_mut()` is always present?
    // additionally, a `&mut String` can only be returned here if it outlives our elided `&'1 mut Vec<String>` lifetime.
    // since we cannot access any reference to a vector without either panicking or somehow unwrapping an `Option`/`Result`, 
    // the only valid return value would be a `&'static mut String`, but mutable statics are unsafe.

    // all this to say, I can't think of a way to return a valid `&mut String` from this function without a panicking path or using `unsafe`, 
    // so we must defer the error handling to the caller, but now we've only multiplied & distributed our problems.
    vec.last_mut(value_index) 
}

// elsewhere

vec.push_and_ref(some_value).unwrap_or_else(|| {
    // what do we do here?
    // This code will *probably* never be executed, but this isn't guaranteed
})

```

What I usually see in these situations is `expect` or `unwrap`.

This is fine if properly tested and due diligence is performed. 
However, I can point to many, many CVEs to evidence that developers donâ€™t always do their due diligence or test all the cases.

Having element access guarantees checked at compile time would prevent these issues;
we need to defer enforcement of these invariant relationships to the compiler.

# Proposal

The rust type system is robust enough to model most of these guarantees via a Typestate pattern.

This can be done by reserving a mutable reference to a vector, stored in an owned `SandboxMut` instance.


This would look something like this
```rust
let mut vec = vec![];
vec.sandboxed_scope(|sandbox| {
    // `sandbox` has unique mutable access to `vec`
})
```

We can then add a constant parameter `MIN_LEN` to sandbox, providing us with some guarantees about the referenced vector.

While this would default to zero, certain operations like `push` could change this value.

These operations would need to take ownership of `sandbox` in order to return a new `sandbox` with a different constant parameter.

```rust
let mut vec = vec![];
vec.sandboxed_scope(|sandbox: SandboxMut<0, _>| {
    let sandbox: SandboxMut<1, _> = sandbox.push(1); // the new sandbox has a minimum length of 1
})
```

Finally, we can separate the different vector operations into different traits, implemented only for certain values of `MIN_LEN`.

For example, `pop()`, `first()`, and `last()` all require at least one element, 
so they can be moved to a `NonEmpty` trait that is implemented for `SandboxMut<N, T>` where `N > 0`

Together, this can provide compile-time guarantees for the previous example:
```rust
// we can safely return a `&mut String` using sandboxing
// this function will not compile if the invariant relationship is broken
fn push_and_ref_sandboxed(vec: &mut Vec<String>, value: String) -> &mut String {
    // we can also just obtain the sandbox directly, without wrapping it in a closure
    vec.sandboxed() 
        .push(value)
        // `release_get` is like `get`, but takes ownership of the sandbox, allowing its returned reference to outlive the sandbox itself
        // -1 is a negative index, indicating the last element of the vector
        .release_get_mut::<-1>() 
}
```
